# Nodeup

An app to manage daily coding warmup exercises. Powered by Node. Inspired by DBC's Socrates.

## User Workflow

1. User login/authentication via Github - DONE
1. Upon login, the end user is presented with a list of exercises (categorized, easily sortable)
1. When the user clicks a specific exercise, the problem is presented (markdown)
1. When the user wants to submit an answer, s/he clicks a button, on the exercise page, which opens a new window to Github, creating a new private gist
1. Once the user clicks the submit button, s/he can view all other submissions
